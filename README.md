# RHUL Robotics Group Project

For the robotics group project, my group and I decided to create a robot that solves a Rubik's cube. We chose this as it would
test all of our abilities and also force us to learn more.

We used colour sensors and motors in our project which helped us learn about translating real world data into useable values in code
and how to process them to ensure there was a high level of accuracy. This was especially important as we had to get the colour values correct
to accurately and efficiently solve the Rubik's cube with no errors.

From this project, I learnt a lot about translating real world data, optimisation and efficiency, time management as well as how to work well in a team environment.
